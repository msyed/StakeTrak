Rubio vs. Cruz: The Race Conservatives Have Dreamed Of
By ISSAC J. BAILEY
And, in a Cruz-Rubio scenario, the grass-roots candidate would be the guy who emulated the establishment candidate’s upstart campaign two years later in Texas.
The tea party has over the years backed some flagrantly unsuitable candidates in Senate primaries — remember Christine O’Donnell? or Chris McDaniel? — but it invested very wisely in Cruz and Rubio.
There is no doubt that the two are now positioned differently. From the beginning of his Senate career, Cruz has focused on bonding with the grass roots of the party, while Rubio sponsored a misbegotten immigration bill that hasn’t been forgotten or forgiven by conservatives. Cruz is working from the right of the party out (he’s strongest among self-identified very conservative voters) and Rubio is working from the center of the party out (he’s strongest among self-identified somewhat conservatives).
There are doubts about both of them. Is Cruz electable? Can Rubio be trusted on immigration? Does Cruz lack a winning personal touch? Is Rubio too youthful-looking? And Donald Trump can’t be wished away.
If Trump wins Iowa, it will indeed be like the First Bull Run of the Republican civil war. Regardless, the race is still highly unpredictable. Chris Christie, in a testament to his resiliency and talents as a communicator, is showing signs of life. Jeb Bush will get another look at some point. The last couple of weeks before Iowa and New Hampshire always bring surprises.
But Republicans hyperventilating over Trump should pause long enough to appreciate the slow but steady rise of two conservative 40-somethings who represent the party’s future.
