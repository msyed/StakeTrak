Police busted three men, two on murder charges, in a knife attack on a 24-year-old man in the Bronx.

Hugo Ivan Galindo of the Bronx was stabbed during a robbery, police said. Sources added he was knifed four times in the chest, back and midsection.

The attack took place on Decatur Ave. in Williamsbridge at 2:45 a.m. Dec. 30.

Surveillance video shows Galindo fighting off six men when one stabbed him and he fell to the ground, sources said.

Four men fled down Decatur Ave. moments after the attack, according to witnesses, but two others stayed behind to rummage through the doomed man’s pockets.

Police arrested Alexi Santiago, 21, the next day, charging him with first-degree gang assault, but not murder.

An NYPD spokesman said investigators couldn’t determine if his actions resulted in Galindo’s death.

Two more suspects, Darnell Jones, 22, and Mark Montos, 21, were arrested Tuesday on second-degree murder charges.

All three suspects hail from the Bronx.

An NYPD spokesman couldn't say Tuesday if Galindo knew his assailants.
